        <h1 id="juho-veps-l-inen">Juho Vepsäläinen</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve been working with computers since I was a small kid though I became more serious about programming only after starting at the university. It was during that time that I became interested in open source. Eventually the path led me to found my own company, SurviveJS Oy, built around educating people about JavaScript. I also became involved in the founding of Finland&#39;s first React and GraphQL conferences and at the moment operate as the director for the first one.</p>
<p>I moved to Vienna from Finland around 2017 and since then I&#39;ve become perhaps more cosmopolitan and cultural person. The time I&#39;ve spent in Austria has made me appreciate Finnish culture and a return to the roots may be in order one day.</p>
<p>By now, I&#39;m an experienced developer, author, and consultant. I&#39;m a known figure in the community and I&#39;ve been awarded for my efforts (Blue Arrow Awards).</p>

<h2 id="freelancing-experience-2011-2014">Freelancing Experience - 2011-2014</h2>
<p>I was a freelancer between 2011 and 2015. My first actual case was in 2010-2011. During that I developed a Canvas element based drawing tool for RateMyDrawings.com. Technologically it was based on RequireJS (module system) and RightJS (jQuery clone).</p>
<p>During 2012 and 2013 I participated in the local startup scene and went through a couple of failures. Incidentally a hobby project, <a href="http://jster.net/">http://jster.net/</a>, became the biggest success of this era.</p>
<p>For NDA reasons I cannot disclose details on my work always but the following should give you idea of the type of work I performed during this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintenance on healthcare related ASP.NET MVC project</li>
<li>QR code based discovery portal using Django</li>
<li>UI based on given PSD using Django for Fudeco, an earlier employer</li>
<li>Photo editor (JS, jQuery) and scraping (Node.js) for <a href="http://brgen.no/">http://brgen.no/</a> . This includes work with Ruby on Rails too.</li>

<h2 id="entrepreneur-at-survivejs-2015-">Entrepreneur at SurviveJS - 2015-</h2>
<p>Given freelancing wasn&#39;t the most fulfilling way for me to live my life, I deduced that I should change my direction. As a result I started authoring technical books related to topics such as React, webpack, and maintenance under the SurviveJS brand. So far I&#39;ve sold over 5000 books self-published. In addition, I&#39;ve performed training and consulting related to the topics.</p>
<p>During this period I had to develop my technical writing and marketing skills and in short doing this changed everything and eventually led me to moving to Vienna, a new environment.</p>
<p>I was awarded for my efforts in 2017 as I was named as the Finnish Code Ambassador by Blue Arrow Awards.</p>
<p>In 2018, I began to organize technical conferences in Finland with a small group of other developers in a voluntary manner. The first event, React Finland held in April, was a great success. It sold out two months before the conference and had around 300 attendees. The three day conference gave us enough confidence to organize another event in October. GraphQL Finland was smaller in scope and although not sold out, it had over 150 attendees and was well received by the community.</p>
<p>The second edition of React Finland in 2019 was even a greater success and it reached 400 attendees while gaining highly favorable feedback. The event was a major step for the brand and overall execution of the event was on a good level. As a director, I was responsible for the overall planning, certain technical bits (asset generator, site), and marketing (content marketing supported by other initiatives).</p>
<p>The third edition of React Finland in 2020 has been full of challenges due to the ongoing pandemic and it has taught a lot about crisis messaging and management while forcing the team to cope with the shifting business environment.</p>
<p>On SurviveJS side, I&#39;ve focused more on consulting since 2017 due to demand. I&#39;ve listed some of my clients below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kapsch - Angular and webpack consulting (workshop) in collaboration with an external developer</li>
<li>eBay - Workshops (webpack, React) and on-site consulting</li>
<li>Kleiner Perkins - Remote consulting as a pair in an internal development project (React, design systems)</li>
<li>ViewAR - On-site consulting as a pair in an internal development project (React, GraphQL, design systems)</li>
<li>Adverity - On-site/remote consulting to improve internal development tooling (webpack)</li>
<li>Stagirite - Remote consulting for an upcoming product</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I&#39;ve run numerous of workshops in countries around Europe. Sometimes these have been done for a specific business and occasionally I&#39;ve run them in conferences. The topics have been mainly webpack and React related although I&#39;ve done occasional marketing consulting as well.</p>
<p>At the moment, I live in Vienna and I am one of the organizers of ViennaJS, React Vienna, and Tech Movie Night while being active and known figure in the community. My time in Vienna has taught me a lot about different cultures while I&#39;ve also picked up the basics of the German language.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-experience">Open Source Experience</h2>
<p>My story with open source begins with Blender. Incidentally I came upon the project through a university course during which I needed to perform some 3D modeling. As it happens one thing lead to another and I ended up modifying the codebase and submitting changes as patches. My previous experience with embedded C came in handy. Eventually I became a maintainer of the node editor of the application and even visited annual Blender Conference a few times, once a speaker.</p>
<p>Since then I have done plenty of development on my own. Most of my projects are available under my GitHub account (<a href="https://github.com/bebraw)">https://github.com/bebraw)</a>. Besides these some reside below the account of a local geek collective, Geek Collision, which I helped to establish (<a href="https://github.com/geekcollision)">https://github.com/geekcollision)</a>. I&#39;ve listed a few examples below. Not all of them might be popular but that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t useful.</p>
