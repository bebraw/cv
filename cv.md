# Juho Vepsäläinen - When Technology Meets Art

Most of the interesting things are at intersections. I have been always such a person. Unable to focus one path I've drifted from area to another. In process I've discovered the importance of fitness and splitting your investments. Failure in one is not end of everything. Something always comes up.

## Education

* 2005-2011 -- **Master of Science**, *University of Jyväskylä*, Mathematical Information Technology (final grade 4/5), Mathematics (3/5), Growth Venturing (4/5). ECTS total 366.
* 2001-2004 -- **Abitur/Technician (electronics)**, *Jyväskylä Educational Consortium*, Electronics and general education (English etc.)

## Freelancing Experience

I have been freelancing since 2011. My first actual case was in 2010-2011. During that I developed a Canvas element based drawing tool for RateMyDrawings.com. Technologically it was based on RequireJS (module system) and RightJS (jQuery clone).

During 2012 and 2013 I participated in the local startup scene and went through a couple of failures. Incidentally a hobby project, http://jster.net/, became the biggest success of this era. There is still plenty of potential for further development and growth.

For NDA reasons I cannot disclose details on my work always but the following should give you idea of the type of work I've performed.

* Maintenance on healthcare related ASP.NET MVC project
* QR code based discovery portal using Django
* UI based on given PSD using Django for Fudeco, an earlier employer
* Photo editor (JS, jQuery) and scraping (Node.js) for http://brgen.no/ . This includes work with Ruby on Rails too.
* NetDNA (Node.js, Angular, Ionic) - https://github.com/MaxCDN/iptell, https://github.com/MaxCDN/osscdn, https://github.com/MaxCDN/ionic-mobile-maxcdn
* Widget development, including backend, on a significant website platform
* Slideshow editor concept design and prototype - https://github.com/bebraw/template_editor
* Scrapers for an iPhone app
* Angular.js consultancy for a legacy project (porting 30 yo. codebase to Angular)

## Pre-freelancing Experience

* 2011 Summer -- **Software Designer**, *Fudeco Oy*. I developed a Django based backend and a frontend (jQuery) related to forums (moderation) for a local media consortium
* 2010-2011 -- **Contractor**, *Mixart New Media LLC*, JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas development
* 2008-2010 -- **3D Modeler, Programmer, Research Assistant**, *University of Jyväskylä*, 3D modeling (Blender) and development (Django, AS2, MediaWiki) for research purposes
* 2005-2009 -- **Volunteer, Maintainer**, *Blender*, Wiki maintenance, software development (C, patch review, design)

## Open Source Experience

My story with open source begins with Blender. Incidentally I came upon the project through a university course during which I needed to perform some 3D modeling. As it happens one thing lead to another and I ended up modifying the codebase and submitting changes as patches. My previous experience with embedded C came in handy. Eventually I became a maintainer of the node section of the application and even visited annual Blender Conference a few times, once a speaker.

Since then I have done plenty of development on my own. Most of my projects are available under my GitHub account (https://github.com/bebraw). Besides these some reside below the account of a local geek collective, Geek Collision, which I helped to establish (https://github.com/geekcollision). I've listed some of my primary projects below. Not all of them might be popular but that doesn't mean they aren't useful.

* jswiki - https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki -- jswiki grew out of an innocent little list of game engines. Details: http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/05/22/web-dev-projects/
* colorjoe - https://github.com/bebraw/colorjoe -- colorjoe was born out of frustration with existing color pickers. All I could find relied on external images. I decided to take another approach and implement the whole thing in JavaScript and CSS. Based on popularity this wasn't a bad choice.
* setjs - https://github.com/bebraw/setjs -- Sadly JavaScript doesn't come with a proper implementation of a Set data structure yet. setjs fixes this issue. I modeled it based on Python API while keeping the API immutable (no side effects).
* sugarjs - https://github.com/sugarjs -- This set of tools grew when I decided to learn to write REST APIs. I developed needed database adapters and a REST adapter. Even though it's not a popular project it has served me well when I need to develop APIs quick.
* annojs - https://github.com/annojs -- This is yet another collection of tools. It contains a QuickCheck inspired testing tool, dependency injection etc. for Node.js.
* Survive JavaScript - http://survivejs.com/ -- This guide takes you from zero to a JavaScript hero. I've condensed parts of my knowledge into this little book.
* CDNperf - http://www.cdnperf.com/ -- I developed this project with a friend of mine in order to monitor performance of JavaScript CDNs. The project was enabled by support from Pingdom.
* jsDelivr API - https://github.com/jsdelivr/api -- I developed this API based on sugarjs tools to provide access to data on JavaScript CDNs. Details: https://gun.io/blog/jsdeliver-api-experiment-to-success/
* Elovalo - https://github.com/elovalo/elovalo -- Elovalo is a led cube project (AVR). I helped to design and implement its effect system and developed a simulation system based on Blender (http://hackaday.com/2012/09/03/simulating-led-cubes-in-blender/). In addition I developed a JavaScript based IDE with interactive editing for the project, https://github.com/elovalo/webide .
